### **About the project:**
As a college student in New York City and as a native New Yorker who is always on the move, I have quite often found it difficult to organize group hangouts. My friends seem to never be available at the same times as me. When we finally decide on a time, knowing what to do or picking the place to go eat/socialize/simply meet up is even more difficult. Many people that I have interviewed, especially those who are in or from NYC, can also attest to this problem. For this reason, this semester, I would like to work on creating a mobile app where users can easily "rally" their friends together when meeting as a group and plan things in an organized manner.

### **Project Status:**
2/20/19: The project is in it's foundational phase right now. The team has started working on requirements engineering, data modeling, end users, user stories, use cases and GitHub Management.  


### **Installation Guidelines:**
This section of the file will be updated as per the status of the project. Currently, we are in the foundation phase of the project. After cloning, forking, or downloading our repository, run **npm install** in order to install the necessary dependencies. 

### **Running Unit Tests**
Clone, fork, or download the branch "unitTestsSprint0" and install the project dependencies with **npm install**. To run the tests with code coverage, use **npm test**. Mocha will recurse through the "test" directory and run each test. Authors of each unit test are written in the comments at the beginning of each file.
